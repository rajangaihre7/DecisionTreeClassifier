# DecisionTreeClassifier
The project involves utilizing a decision tree classifier to predict the presence or absence of diabetes based on nine parameters: 'pregnant', 'glucose', 'bp' (blood pressure), 'skin', 'insulin', 'bmi' (body mass index), 'pedigree', 'age', and 'label'. The classifier aims to analyze these parameters and make predictions about whether an individual is likely to have diabetes.
The achieved accuracy for the model is reported to be 67.09%, indicating the percentage of correct predictions made by the decision tree classifier in distinguishing cases of diabetes.
